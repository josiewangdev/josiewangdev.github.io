Attracted by the lifestyle of foreign countries, eager to break out of my comfort zone and desire of free, I quitted my job and started my journey to Australia.

About Sep 2016, I applied the Working Holiday Visa of Australia. This Visa ensures the legitimacy of my work.

On 7th Mar, 2017, I landed on Melbourne.

Hadn't finished the first day in Melbourne, I already got rid of the sense of strangeness. It's just like I had been living here for a very long time, since I can hear my native language speakers everywhere.

When I stayed in Melbourne, I lived with my friends who studied in Melbourne University. And so luckily that we spend the Moomba Festival together.
